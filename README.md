# learn-clef

An excellent tool when you want to learn a new clef, whether it's for band, choir, music theory, or just your own hobby.

I originally designed this when I wanted to learn Tenor clef but couldn't find any good resources. Realizing that other people might have the same problem, I extended the code to fit other clefs. (With the new code setup, I replaced Tenor with Alto)

So far, the only clefs supported are Treble, Alto, and Bass. More clefs can be added at [request](https://seewitheyesclosed.com/contact/) or by dropping a pull request.
